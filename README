some of the code in here is original source code from the XINU book. 
The rest is my modifications to make it run as an emulation on linux

Includes CLI with capability to create processes, suspend, kill, put to sleep,
create semaphores, wait on semaphores, send messages. 

Processes are created with a custom thread package using the u_context set 
of fuctions on linux e.g. makecontext, swapcontext...

No filesystem.
